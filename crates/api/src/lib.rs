//!
//! The Carbide API server library.

// It's too cumbersome for tests to adhere to these, which are less important in testing anyway.
#![cfg_attr(test, allow(txn_held_across_await))]
#![cfg_attr(test, allow(txn_without_commit))]

// NOTE on pub vs non-pub mods:
//
// carbide-api is a CLI crate, not a lib. The only reason we have lib.rs is to export things so that
// the `api-test` crate can do integration tests against carbide-api. And even that is a compromise:
// `api-test` should be as "black box" as possible, and we should only be exporting things like the
// main `run()` function and some [`cfg`] types, so that api-test can run a full carbide server.
// Otherwise, lib.rs should be mostly private ("mod", not "pub mod" in these lines), so that we get
// working dead-code detection: If modules here are public, rust will not find dead code for
// anything marked `pub` within the module.
